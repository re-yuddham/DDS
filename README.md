# Application using Distributed Database

![example¬†workflow](https://github.com/re-yuddham/DDS/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Locally¬†it¬†runs¬†upto¬†3¬†instances.

```bash
sh startScript.sh
```

To¬†run¬†the¬†load¬†test¬†on¬†the¬†application

```bash
node loadTest.js
```

## TiDb configuration used for the application.

| Component | Count | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TiDb Server | 2   | Database is responsible for holding all the data. Asynchronous replication is performed on all instances to keep the consistency. |
| Placement Driver | 3   | Placement drivers are responsible for holding metadata information for the running cluster. |
| TiKV | 3   | Key-value store used by the TiDb Server.¬† Row based storage of values. |
| TiFlash | 1   | Columnar storage of values. |

## The Application

Application is developed in Typescript <img src="https://hackr.io/tutorials/typescript/logo-typescript.svg?ver=1610119323" width=20 height=20> and its implemented with very basic `regions ` concept. Let's have a look through the major components of the application.

#### Database Config

Since our `TiDb` has 2 endpoints exposed we will use `localhost:4000` for `IND` and `EU` regions and for the `US` we will use `localhost:4001`

> Note ‚Ñπ Since the application is created for demonstration purposes we have hardcoded the backing service configs here. In production environments a seperate scaling service is used for this purpose.

#### Connection Pool

Since we are in javascript environment we have kept the connection pooling as `async` as possible.

### Measurements

We ran the application with multiple configuration. Here are some of the observations.

> Note ‚Ñπ Following measurements are taken on a machine with 2.7 GHz processor and 16 GB RAM. The actual production measurements are subject to change. Consider these observations at your own risk ‚ö†.

## Auto-Scaling

Although autoscaling is documented in the `tidb` official documentation, we had a tough time configuring it in local. `Kubernetes` is used to automatically scale out the `TiDb` server.

[Official Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/dev/get-started) All the best üëç

## Conclusion

`TiDb` offers a nice learning opportunity for those who want to venture into the wilderness of distributed systems.

### The performance

Key aspects of the TiDb servers are horizontally scaled architecture and the load balancing components such as Linux Virtual Server (LVS), HAProxy, or F5.

276 Queries per second. ( not bad üëè)

Query execution time stays within the `50ms` benchmark. Queries per second reaches `276` mark.

## Usability

`TiDb` comes along with a nice package of monitors and performance visualizer tools.

### Grafana

Apart from the auto-scaling problem we did not run into any hic-cups while making this project. Would recommend it `9/10`
